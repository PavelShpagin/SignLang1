Run the analysis (no notebook):

    python run_nb.py

This generates all figures and prints results. To compile the report PDF:

    powershell .\tools\compile_report.ps1

To use the notebook instead: open hand_gesture_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter, then Run All.
If the kernel hangs or is slow, close the notebook and use "python run_nb.py" above.
